  input:
    rent: 12_000
    adjusted_family_net_income: 40_000
  output:
    # Step 1 - Occupancy cost
    # 20% of rent = $2,400
    # Step 2 - Energy component
    # Not on long-term care home or reserve, so $0.
    # Step 3 - Property tax component
    # A: 10% of $2,400 = $240
    # A or $499, whichever is less = $240
    # Add $529 = $769
    # $769 or $2,400, whichever is less = $769
    # Step 4 - Energy and property tax credit
    # A. Add the result of Step 2 and Step 3 = $769
    # B: Subtract $31,144.00 from your adjusted family net income for 2021
    #    (if negative, the result is zero) = $8,856
    # C: Multiply B by 2% = $177.12
    # D. Subtract C from A = $591.88
    # E. Divide D by 2 = $295.94
    # F. Subtract $37,373.00 from your adjusted family net income for 2021
    #    (if negative, the result is zero) = $2,627
    # G. Multiply F by 2% = $52.54
    # H. Subtract G from A = $716.44
    # I. Divide H by 2 = $358.22
    # J. Add E and I = $654.16
